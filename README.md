# Description
A program to measure the current temperature(and relative humidity, if supported by the sensor) using an ESP32 or ESP8266.  
This program has a default mode in which the ESP runs continuously and outputs data frequently,  
and a Deep Sleep Mode in which it is off for most of the time and outputs data less frequently.

## Web Interface  
This program shows the measurements on a simple web interface.  
This web interface updates its values every 2 seconds using javascript.

## Deep Sleep Mode
Deep Sleep Mode is a operating mode where the ESP pushes metrics once, and then sleeps for a predefined time.  
After that it wakes up and pushes metrics again.  
This cycle is repeated indefinitely.  
In this mode the Web Server and ArduinoOTA support are disabled.  
Note: For this to work on the ESP8266 you need to connect the GPIO 16 to the RST pin.

# Hardware support
A list of supported microcontrollers and temperature sensors.

## Microcontrollers
A list of supported microcontrollers.
 * ESP32DevKitC
 * ESP8266DevKitC

## Temperature sensors
A list of supported temperature sensors along with their required pull up resistor.  
Format: Sensor(Pull Up Resistor)
 * DHT22(10K味立)
 * DS18B20(4.7K立)

# Requirements
 1. A supported microcontroller
 2. A supported temperature sensor
 3. The Pull Up Resistor for said sensor
 4. USB-Micro-B tp USB-A cable
 5. PC with a working [platformio](https://platformio.org/) installation

# Getting Started
The steps to compile this project and flash it onto an esp.  

 * Connect your esp to your temperature sensor. Wiring for the DHT22:

    |ESP Pin       |DHT22 Pin|
    |--------------|---------|
    |5V            |VCC      |
    |5V(10K立),GPIO5|Data     |
    |GND           |GND      |

 * Create a wifissid.txt file containing the SSID of the wifi to connect to.
 * Create a wifipass.txt file containing the Passphrase for the wifi to connect to.
 * Create a otapass.txt file containing the password for [ArduinoOta](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/arduinoota/), allowing your to upload modified versions over wifi.
 * Create a mqttuser.txt file containing the username to use to connect to the MQTT broker.  
   For technical reasons this is required even if you do not use MQTT.
 * Create a mqttpass.txt file containing the password for the MWTT broker.   
   For technical reasons this is required even if you do not use MQTT.
 * Make sure these five files don't end with an empty line.
 * Attach the ESP to your PC using a USB-Micro-B tp USB-A cable.
 * Build this project and flash it to the ESP by running `pio run -t upload -e esp32dev` for ESP32 or `pio run -t upload -e esp_wroom_02` for the ESP8266.
 * To upload over WiFi after this project is installed run `pio run -t upload -e esp32dev_ota` for an ESP32 or `pio run -t upload -e esp_wroom_02_ota` for an ESP8266.
 * Run `pio device monitor` to open a serial connection.
 * Wait a few seconds for the ESP to finish booting.
 * Enter `ip` and press return to get the device ip.
 * Enter the IPv4 ip(for example 192.168.2.101) returned by this into your browser to see the web interface, showing your current temperature and relative humidity.

# Prometheus integration
This project is designed to work with [prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) either using through providing a metrics page to scrape, or by pushing to a [prometheus-pushgateway](https://github.com/prometheus/pushgateway).  
This repository also contains a [grafana](https://grafana.com/) dashboard to visualize the data collected by [prometheus](https://prometheus.io/).

## Prometheus metrics endpoint
To enable the [prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) metrics endpoint simply ensure that `ENABLE_PROMETHEUS_SCRAPE_SUPPORT` in config.h is set to 1.   
The necessary metrics for this are provided on /metrics on the normal web server(port 80 by default) on the esp.  
This repository also contains the necessary kubectl manifests to configure [kube-prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/kube-prometheus) to scrape the data from this metrics endpoint.  
To install this [kube-prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/kube-prometheus) integration simply run `kubectl apply -f integration/kube-prometheus-scrape.yaml` in the project root on the server.  
This configures [kube-prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/kube-prometheus) to scrape /metrics on the esp(the IP has to be set in the yaml) every 10 seconds.  
This change might take a few minutes until it applies, so don't worry if you don't have data immediately.

## Prometheus pushgateway
To make the esp atomatically push data to a [prometheus-pushgateway](https://github.com/prometheus/pushgateway) enable `ENABLE_PROMETHEUS_PUSH` in config.h.  
Additionally set `PROMETHEUS_PUSH_ADDR` to the address of your [prometheus-pushgateway](https://github.com/prometheus/pushgateway).  
If you are running the [prometheus-pushgateway](https://github.com/prometheus/pushgateway) on a port other then the default(9091) set the port it is listening on in `PROMETHEUS_PUSH_PORT`.  
To configure the job, instance, and namespace of the data you can also set `PROMETHEUS_PUSH_JOB`, `PROMETHEUS_PUSH_INSTANCE`, and `PROMETHEUS_PUSH_NAMESPACE`, but leaving them as their default values should be fine.  
After configuring this simply compile the project and upload it to your esp.

## Grafana
After following either set of instructions to enable [prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) integration the [grafana](https://grafana.com/) dashboard can be set up by following these steps:
 * Open your [grafana](https://grafana.com/) instance and Log in as a user with the required permissions to create a dashboard.
 * Hover over the '+' on the left side of the page.
 * Click "Import".
 * Click "Upload .json file".
 * Select the "grafana-dashboard.json" file in the "kube-prometheus" folder.
 * Click "Import".
