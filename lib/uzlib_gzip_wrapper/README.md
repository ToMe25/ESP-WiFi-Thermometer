# UZLib GZIP Wrapper
This is a [UZLib](https://github.com/pfalcon/uzlib.git) wrapper specifically used to (de)compress GZIP files.

**IMPORTANT:** The current version of this library cannot handle compression yet.

This wrapper can handle both decompressing a file from a constant byte array, as well as from a callback.

This wrapper can handle a custom window size.

There are no usage examples at this point in time.
